# Artistic Nueral Transfer 🖌️🎨🧠

In this repository I implement the paper [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, and Matthias Bethge.

By using a deep CNN trained on a large dataset, we can extract **content** features and **style** features in order to produce the desired combination.
